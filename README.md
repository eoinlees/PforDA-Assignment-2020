# Programming for Data Analytics - numpy.random - Assignment
## Eoin Lees - G00387888 - November 2020


The following program is an assignment for the programming for data analytics module in November 2020. 

It's purpose was to get an in depth understanding of the `numpy.random` package. 

It is run using Jupyter notebooks.

It can be read directly from git hub, however for full functionallity please download and run directly from your desktop. 

### Jupyter notebooks
* Installation
    Visit https://jupyter.org/ and follow instructions to install on your macine
* To Run
    Navigate to the correct folder in the console and type the following command: Jupyter notebooks
    Use the gui provided in the web explorer and select `Assignment-2020.ipynb`

### Assignment Brief

The assignment brief was the following:

    1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
    2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
    3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
    4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

It was broken down into 4 sections and answered with examples. Each section has its references built in along with a full list at the end of the document. 

### Results

After compiling all of the research and information into the summary  jupyter notebook document I believe I have a much deeper understanding of the the `numpy.random` package. I am confident that in future usage of the package I will be able to refer back to this document and use it as a starting off point for working on problems.
